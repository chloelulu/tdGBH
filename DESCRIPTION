Description: Two-Dimensional Group Benjamini-Hochberg (tdGBH) Procedure is a multiple testing procedure that offers enhanced power over traditional FDR control methods when the data presents two-way grouping structure. It reweights the p-values based on the informativeness of the respective grouping directions. It requires a matrix of p-values as input with rows and columns corresponding to the two grouping directions (e.g. genes by cell types).
