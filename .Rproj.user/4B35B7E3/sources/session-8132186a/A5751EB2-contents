# tdGBH

The goal of tdGBH is to perform two-dimensional group Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate control in Two-Way multiple testing.

## Installation

You can install tdGBH like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("chloelulu/tdGBH")
```

## Example

The input matrix includes raw p-values that represent the association between the intake of 214 different nutrients and the abundance of 37 bacterial genera. Results returns the tdGBH adjusted p values storaged in a matrix with the same dimension as the input matrix. 
```{r example}
# library(tdGBH)
# data(P)
# res <- tdGBH(P)
```
