Description: tdGBH is a multiple testing procedure that offers enhanced power over traditional FDR control methods like BH or ST. This is achieved by assigning data-informed weights to each hypothesis. Specifically, tdGBH conducts a two-dimensional group Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, targeting false discovery rate control within Two-Way multiple testing scenarios. It requires a matrix of p-values as input, structured with features as rows and outcomes as columns.
